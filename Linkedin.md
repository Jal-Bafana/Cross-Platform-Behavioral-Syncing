🚀 Proud to share the launch of our collaborative full-stack project — Smart Learning Dashboard — built by a team of three passionate developers (👨‍💻👩‍💻👨‍💻)!

This platform is designed to give users personalized learning insights by syncing data from platforms like GitHub and Google, recommending skills and courses, and providing visual feedback on learning activity — all in one clean, interactive dashboard.

🔧 What we built:
✅ OAuth authentication with GitHub & Google using NextAuth.js
✅ Fully responsive UI using Next.js and Tailwind CSS
✅ Sidebar + Top Navbar for intuitive navigation
✅ Personalized home screen showing welcome message, learning recommendations, and two charts:

📈 Activity Over Time (Line/Bar Chart)

🧠 Topic Breakdown (Pie/Doughnut Chart)
✅ Profile Page displaying GitHub/YouTube (mock) data
✅ Recommendations & Activity Pages with clean, modular design
✅ Smooth transitions & hover effects powered by Tailwind and Framer Motion

This project was a fantastic exercise in building scalable components, modular pages, and integrating frontend with a real working backend setup. The entire codebase is structured to support future API/data integration smoothly.

Big thanks to my amazing teammates for their energy and contributions throughout! 🙌
We’re super excited about the possibilities this opens up for future learning tools.
